# Turn off the Windows Terminal bell sound
A bell sound occurs when pressing the tab key and hitting a navigation boundary - it's very annoying.

Follow these steps to turn it off:

1. In the terminal, click the chevron drop-down (after the "+" for adding a new tab).
2. Click on a profile in the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the "Advanced" tab.
4. Find the "Bell notification style" section at the bottom.
5. Untick "audible".
6. Click the save button and rejoice.

or set the `bellStyle` option to `none` in the json config file
